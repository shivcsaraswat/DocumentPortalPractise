As a final-year student pursuing a double degree in Computer Science from the University of Waterloo \\nand Business Administration from Wilfrid Laurier University, I am excited by the opportunity to apply technology \\nto drive investment decisions in a fund managing over $38 billion in assets. \\nTechnical Excellence with Analytical Depth \\nMy computer science background provides programming knowledge and analytical mindset essential for \\nquantitative development. Through coursework in Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Optimization, \\ncombined with experience in Python, R, and SQL, I have developed the foundation to work with your \\ntechnology stack. My passion for learning new technologies was demonstrated when I mastered React.js \\nduring a live PwC project, delivering under tight deadlines. \\nAt Dare Foods, I developed a Decision Tree Regression model on complex datasets to optimize shelf \\nplacement strategies, resulting in an expected 5% sales lift. I also created a novel data integration approach \\ncombining disparate data sources to calculate SKU penetration growth—solving a problem existing practices \\nhad deemed unfeasible. This innovative problem-solving approach directly applies to quantitative equity \\ndevelopment. \\nInvestment Domain Interest \\nMy business degree, particularly coursework in Investment Management and Options, Futures and \\nDerivatives, has fostered genuine interest in financial markets. At PepsiCo, I engineered a machine learning \\nmodel that reduced forecasting time from 12 weeks to 11 hours across 105 accounts, demonstrating how \\nalgorithmic solutions can transform operational efficiency—skills that transfer directly to quantitative investment \\nstrategies. \\nCollaborative Problem-Solving \\nYour emphasis on collaboration aligns with my experience leading cross-functional teams. At PwC, I led 3 \\nassociates in architecting a disaster recovery strategy for a multi-million-dollar RFP that we successfully won. I \\nregularly translate technical capabilities into business value, presenting project impacts to executives including \\nPepsiCo's VP of Strategy and Transformation—exactly the communication needed when working with portfolio \\nmanagers and analysts. \\nWhy Connor, Clark & Lunn \\nI am particularly drawn to CC&L's entrepreneurial culture and your position within the broader CC&L Financial \\nGroup managing over $155 billion in assets. The opportunity to own the entire software lifecycle—from \\ncollaborating on investment problems to implementing solutions—appeals to my desire for end-to-end impact \\nin Vancouver's innovative West Coast environment. \\nI am excited to bring my analytical rigor, technical skills, and business understanding to help develop the \\ninnovative technologies that power your quantitative strategies. Thank you for considering my application. \\nSincerely, \\n Shiv Chandra Saraswat\"),\n",

WatDFS \\nwill act as a transparent layer on top of the local file system to support creat-ing, opening, \\nreading, writing, and closing files on remote machines. The Project comes in 2 parts. In P1, \\nyou will first implement WatDFS using a remote access model (Section 6). In P2, you will \\nextend P1 to support a download/upload model with client-side caching (Section 7).\\nTo implement the WatDFS file system, you will integrate with FUSE,1 a popular library that \\nenables the development of custom file systems. We will provide a library that takes care of \\nsetting up the FUSE functionality for you. We will also provide an RPC library that you will \\nuse to make remote procedure calls between the WatDFS client and server.\\nThis document presents an overview of FUSE (Section 2) and describes how you should \\nintegrate your solution with FUSE (Section 3). It also describes the API of the provided \\nRPC library (Section 4), tips for doing the project (Section 6 and 7), and pointers to more \\nresources (Section 5). Section 8 contains answers to frequently asked questions and \\nsolutions to common problems you may encounter while implementing WatDFS.\\nEnsure that you have read all the relevant parts of this document before begin-\\nning the project as it contains answers to many frequently asked questions and \\ntips to avoid common pitfalls during implementation.\\n1https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse\\n3'),\n",

To do so, the distributed file system presents an interface that\\nacts as if remote files are located on the local file system and are therefore accessible through\\nstandard system calls likeopen, close, read, andwrite.\\nFUSE presents the interface of a standard file system, and therefore maintains access trans-\\nparency. Additionally, FUSE requires no kernel code modification. FUSE consists of two\\nparts: the FUSE kernel driver and the librarylibfuse. Libfuse integrates with the Linuxvir-\\ntual file systemand passes calls on to a user space library such as WatDFS, the distributed\\nfile system that you will implement.\\nBelow is a diagram that traces the steps (indicated by numbered arrows) that a file system\\noperation (such as reading a file) invoked by an application (e.g., thecat command) will\\ntake to reach WatDFS, as well as the actions that WatDFS should take. The dashed lines\\nindicate separate processes, the thick gray lines separate machine boundaries, and the thin\\ngray lines separate user space from the kernel. You will be responsible for implementing the\\nWatDFS client and WatDFS server components.\\n1. An application (e.g.,cat or os.open() in Python) performs a file system operation\\nby making a system call (such asopen(), close(), read(), orwrite()). This system\\ncall is passed to the Linux kernel.\\n2. The kernel redirects the system call to the virtual file system (VFS).\\n3. In general, the VFS transforms the system call into an appropriate call against the file\\n4'),\n",

In WatDFS, the VFS will detect that the file system\\ncall is to be served by WatDFS, a FUSE-based file system. Consequently, the call is\\npassed to the FUSE kernel driver.\\n4. The FUSE kernel driver delivers the call tolibfuse, which will pass the calls on to the\\nWatDFS client library that you’ll implement.\\n5. The WatDFS client library makes an RPC call to the WatDFS RPC server with details\\nabout the system call being performed.\\n6. The WatDFS RPC server receives the RPC call and calls the appropriate functions in\\nthe WatDFS server implementation.\\n7. The WatDFS server performs the indicated system call against the local file system\\nand receives a response from the file system.\\n8. The WatDFS server responds to the RPC call, sending back data and return codes\\nfrom the system call.\\n9. The RPC response is passed back to the WatDFS client library and the client library\\ngenerates a response to the FUSE driver’s request.\\n10. The WatDFS client library forwards the FUSE response to the FUSE driver.\\n11. The FUSE driver passes the response back to the VFS.\\n12. The VFS translates the file system response back into a system call response for the\\nkernel.\\n13. The application receives the result of the system call.\\nTo complete P1 and P2, you must implement steps 5–10 for various file system operations \\n(described in Section 3) with the assistance of the provided libraries. To test your system \\nlocally, you will need to use command line applications (e.g., cat, stat) or write small \\nC++ or Python code snippets (e.g., os.read()) that can perform end-to-end tests indicated \\nby steps 1–13. When you submit your code, we will test the WatDFS client and server \\nfunctionality that you’ve written both individually and with complete end-to-end tests. This \\ntesting of your code will be done through automated tests on Marmoset. Consequently, \\nit is important that you implement the project exactly as this document \\nspecifies.\\nWatDFS execution architecture: Only one application (e.g. cat) will interact with \\nyour WatDFS client at a time.2 However, there may be multiple WatDFS client instances \\nthat are connected to the same WatDFS server. In other words, the WatDFS client has to \\nprocess only one request at a time, while the WatDFS server needs to account for multiple \\nconcurrent requests.\\nIntegrating with FUSE requires mapping the FUSE kernel driver’s calls to functions in the \\nclient WatDFS library. We have implemented this mapping, while filtering out file system \\ncalls that are not relevant to the project (e.g. directory operations). Your task is to \\nimplement the WatDFS library functions needed to support key FUSE operations, which we \\ndescribe in the next section.\\n2This restriction simplifies development for this project; FUSE supports multiple client applications \\ninteracting with the same user space libfuse library.\\n5'),\n",

You will need\\nto consult the Linux man pages to find the corresponding system call that must be made\\nto support each libfuse function. Some pointers on helpful system calls are provided in\\nSection 5.2. Below, we also provide links to the related libfuse calls that provide more\\ndetails on the specifications of the functions.\\n3.1 General Notes\\nIn general, the calls made by FUSE should return0 on success, or-errno if an error occurs\\n(the exceptions areread and write). This behaviour differs from system calls, which\\ntypically return 0 on success and -1 on error. If an error occurs, system calls set\\nerrno to a positive number to indicate what went wrong. You can find the complete list of\\nerrno in errno-base.h and errno.h.\\nlibfuse always provides path names of the file it wishes to operate on, but using names rather\\nthan file descriptors results in more expensive lookups and metadata tracking. Therefore,\\nsome libfuse functions take a fuse_file_info structure. This structure has an integer\\nmember variablefh, which you should set in theopen function call and use afterwards to\\nidentify the file (i.e., act as a file descriptor).3\\nstruct fuse_file_info {\\nint flags; // open flags, available in open and release.\\n/* other fields */\\nuint64_t fh; // file handle, may be filled in by open\\n};\\nThe path argument isrelative to the directorywhere FUSE is mounted.\\nThe FUSE function calls you will implement accept an additionaluserdata argument that\\nprovides contextual and state information, which we describe shortly. If you are uncertain\\nabout other arguments and their types used in the (e.g.,mode_t), additional information\\ncan be found by searching thelibfuse headers4 or Linux headers.\\n3.2 Initialization and Destruction\\nThese two functions are used to initialize thelibfuse integration and cleanup on shutdown\\nrespectively.\\n3.2.1 watdfs_cli_init\\nvoid *watdfs_cli_init(struct fuse_conn_info *conn,\\nconst char *path_to_cache, time_t cache_interval\\n3Although you could implement the project using only the file names that are provided in the \\nfunction arguments, you must use the fuse_file_info for both performance and compatibility with the \\nautomated tests.\\n4libfuse/fuse.h\\n6'),\n",

Be extra careful with the\\ndata types and settings for each RPC call, as they can be easily mixed up.\\n4.2 Registering RPC calls on the server with rpcRegister\\nFunction calls must be registered usingrpcRegister before they can be used by remote\\nclients. This function tells the RPC library which function to call at the server when a client\\nexecutes anrpcCall with a specified name and arguments.\\nint rpcRegister(char *name, int *argTypes, skeleton f);\\n// skeleton is defined as:\\ntypedef int (*skeleton)(int *, void **);\\nHere, skeleton f is the address of a server function that is mapped to a given rpcname by\\nthe server. Skeletons return an integer error code indicating success with a zero or failure\\nwith a negative error code. The inputs and outputs of the skeleton functions are provided as\\narguments to the skeleton and marked as inputs or outputs respectively using the separate\\nargTypes array (see below).\\nrpcRegister will return an integer indicating success (0) or failure (a negative number).\\nThe argTypes array specifies the types of the argument, and whether the argument is an\\ninput, output, or both for the function call. Each argument has an integer to encode the\\ntype information (refer to the tables described in Section 4.1), which will collectively form\\nthe argTypes array. Theargs array is an array of pointers to the different arguments, which\\nwill be discussed in the next section. Thus,argTypes[0] specifies the type information for\\nargs[0], and so on.\\nSince it is not known how many arguments there are, the last value in theargTypes array\\nmust be 0. Consequently, the size ofargTypes is 1 greater than the size ofargs. There is\\nno restriction on the number of input and output arguments placed in theargs vector or\\nhow they are ordered. However, theargTypes array must correctly correlate with theargs\\nvector.\\nThe argTypes integer (of size 4 bytes) consists of the following sub-components:\\n1. The first byte will specify the input/output nature of the argument. Specifically, if the\\nfirst bit is set then the argument is input to the server. If the second bit is set the\\nargument is output from the server. The third bit indicates whether the argument is\\nan array type. The remaining 5 bits of this byte are currently undefined and must be\\nset to 0. For convenience, the following definitions are provided:\\n12'),\n",

The last two bytes of the argument type integer specify the length of the array. Hence,\\narrays are limited to a length of216 − 1 (defined asMAX_ARRAY_LEN).

It is expected that the client\\nprogrammer will have reserved sufficient space for the buffers used for any input/output\\nof type arrays.\\nExample: To indicate an input array of 20 integers, you can set theargType to:\\n(1 << ARG_INPUT) | (1 << ARG_ARRAY) | (ARG_INT << 16) | 20.\\nNote: When a function is registered withrpcRegister, the server does not know the length\\nof the array that the client will set; therefore, on the server side, you must specify the length\\nof the array as 1 in the call torpcRegister.\\nWe show a full example of registering asum function that calculates the sum of all numbers\\nin an int array:\\n#define ARG_COUNT 2 // Number of RPC arguments\\n#define LENGTH 1u // It is an array\\n// Create the argTypes array.

The logfile is stored aswatdfs.log\\nin the directory where you start your client.\\nRecall from Section3.1 that libfuse expects functions to return 0 or-errno. However, most\\nsystem calls (e.g. stat) return 0 or -1, and seterrno. If a system call returns -1, in your\\nWatDFS server you should setretcode in the RPC call to-errno and in the WatDFS client\\nreturn that error from your function tolibfuse.\\n6.6.1 Handling failures\\nEnsure that you are checking the return values of all function calls you make. A non-\\nzero return usually indicates an error (except for theread and write calls as described\\nin Section 3.5). You should detect errors just after the function call that caused it and\\nreturn the error code appropriately.Failing to check the return code of functions is\\na common source of bugs.\\n6.6.2 Assumptions about the system\\nYou can assume that the server and client will not fail or crash during normal operations.\\nYou can also assume that both the client and server will have the appropriate directory\\npermissions to create and modify files. In general, the errors that you need to handle are\\nsystem call and rpc call failures.\\n6.6.3 Specific Do’s and Don’ts\\n• Do not use strlen(buffer) to calculate the length of buffers. The buffers used in \\nread and write calls are not char arrays representing strings. You should assume that \\nbuffers contain arbitrary binary content that is not delimited by ‘\\\\0’.\\n• Do add small comments, for example to remind you what you did in P1 that might be \\nhelpful for P2.\\n• Do make good use of functions (and macros), instead of giving in to the temptation of \\ncopy pasting code.\\n• Don’t change the WatDFS client interface. We will be using these interfaces to run \\nthe FUSE client.

Alternatively, if you need more control over the \\ncalls you want to make, create test Python10 or C++ programs that directly make the \\nsystem calls you want. Doing so is a good way to replicate the tests yourself. You should \\nlook at the watdfs.log file to verify how your application calls are being translated into \\nlibfuse operations. You can figure out what system calls a tool like cat makes using strace \\n(https://linux.die.net/man/1/strace).\\n8.2 How do I debug my code?\\nConsult the log files (watdfs.log, rpc_client.log, and rpc_server.log) to see what \\noperations have taken place. Add debug print statements to your code, or use gdb to step \\nthrough the operations that have taken place.\\nImportant: When adding debug print statements, make sure to use the DLOG function and \\nNOT std::cout.\\nImportant: If you come to office hours, make sure you have tried to reproduce the error \\nyou’re getting and have a sequence of logs that we can look at. Additionally, please ensure \\nthat you have submitted your (current) code to Marmoset so that the TAs can access it. \\nTAs cannot help you with programming issues without access to both the log \\ntrace and code submission on Marmoset.\\n8.3 I tried debugging for hours but still cannot figure out why my\\nprogram is failing. What should I do?\\nKeep the WatDFS architecture in mind. Recall Section2, there are multiple calls being\\nmade—application->WatDFS client->server using RPC->file system—and back. The logs\\nthat we provide and your own print statements should be able to tell you which of these\\ncalls are failing. In particular:\\n• Did you test onlinux.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca? Sometimes subtle errors discov-\\nered by Marmoset are hit only when executed in the same environment.\\n• Did the client and server initialize properly?\\n• Are allrpcRegister calls correct? Did the registrations succeed?\\n• Are therpcCalls succeeding? Are you setting the correct RPC arguments and their\\ntypes according to the protocol?\\n• Are you setting the correct arguments and flags to the function calls? In particular,\\ncheck the arguments to the system calls (open, stat, etc) you’re making. Did you set\\n10https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html\\n30'),\n",

In\\ngeneral, you should checkwatdfs.log; if you see a call log containingunimpl_*, that means\\nthe operation is not supported by WatDFS. Note that we do not expect your WatDFS code\\nto handle any directory operations.\\n8.5 Why aren’t my RPC calls working?\\nCheck your logs. Make sure that you are exporting the correct server address and port to\\nyour client, and that you are callingrpcClientInit. You can check what server address and\\nport the client is trying to connect to by checking therpc_client.log file. You can check\\nwhat server address and port the server is listening on by checking therpc_server.log file.\\nMore generally you should check the return codes from RPC library functions and compare\\nthem to the error codes defined inrpc.h. Finally, try comparing the argument types in\\nthe rpc_client.log and rpc_server.log, with the expected arguments registered at the\\nserver.\\n8.6 Why is FUSE trying to do file operations after I returned an\\nerror inwatdfs_cli_getattr?\\nSee Section 3.3. If you return an error inwatdfs_cli_getattr, but there is information in\\nthe stat structure, then FUSE assumes the stat structure is correct. Make sure your stat\\nstructure has no data set in it if you are returning an error in these calls.\\n8.7 Why is FUSE returning the error: “fuse: bad mount point\\n‘client_mount_dir’: Transport endpoint is not connected”?\\nSee Section 6.3. It is likely that there was alibfuse instance running which has not terminated\\n(or it has crashed) that hadclient_mount_dir as a mount point. You should clean up state\\nby running:\\n$ fusermount -u /path/to/client_mount_dir\\n31'),\n",

First, your WatDFS client may be returning-1 instead of\\n-errno. Note that -EPERM is -1, which indicates a permission error. Or second, new files\\ncreated by your WatDFS code, either on the server or the client, might not have the right\\npermissions by default, subsequently giving an error when trying to read those files. The\\nopen manpage has instructions on how to set file permissions explicitly.\\n8.10 Why do my Marmoset tests timeout?\\nIt is likely that you are not specifying the correctargTypes in yourrpcCall, or that theargs\\ndo not match theargTypes.

You should use directories that are not replicated (i.e., do not pick your\\nhome directory). You should also pick directories that are unique. The easiest directories to\\npick are subdirectories under/tmp/$USER/, which you may need to create.\\n8.12 My Marmoset test has an error, what do I do?\\nThe output trace of the test will print out file-system operations that have succeeded and\\noperations that have failed.
